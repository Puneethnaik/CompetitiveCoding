# Letter most
Simple concept of maintaining a frequency table for the given string and printing the maximum frequency of all the characters in the alphabet set.

# Plan for nothing
feels like binary search
can be solved using binary search on the index of the day

# Lonely M's array
a subsequence problem, have seen problem before, have to take some examples and test
seems to be a dp problem
It is an extension of the longest alternating subsequence
completed by some observation

# Two papers I


# Array Modification 
This is a greedy problem. Was able to solve it. However, need to prove it on paper.

# Two papers II
first create a maximum spanning tree of the graph
then if the number of edges with weight 1 is odd, we are done
else do the following:
    for every edge in the tree of weight 1, find an adjacent edge of weight 0, if there is atleast one such occurence, then we are done, otherwise, we dont have any answer.
There seems to be a problem with the scoring. Weak test cases.
